## OpenFlydigi

Credit to [OpenFlydigi](https://github.com/mkaliaha/openflydigi) by Mikalai Kaliaha
for the prototype development and protocol work behind the Apex6 Pro integration.

The Flydigi identity request/reply layout, Apex 5 DeviceType allowlist, and
related protocol behavior, and the DualSense adaptive-trigger translation in
`src/dualsense/AdaptiveTriggerTranslation.*`, were ported from and
validated against OpenFlydigi:

- Project: https://github.com/mkaliaha/openflydigi
- Reference commit: `8477300f1bd0cdd0e4a277a544aa9b151c623e62`
- Reference files: `flydigi/device.py`, `flydigi/identity.py`,
  `flydigi/motion.py`, `flydigi/effects.py`, `flydigi/ds5.py`,
  `flydigi/relay.py`, and `PROTOCOL.md`
- Copyright: 2026 Mikalai Kaliaha
- License for the referenced implementation: MIT

The transport-free Apex6 codec and DSP in `src/apex6/Gpa6.*` and
`src/apex6/GripDsp.*` additionally derives from the modified OpenFlydigi source
in a supplied development source bundle, not the older commit above. These
components are reused by the integrated backend. Copyright and MIT terms below
apply. Pinned source SHA-256:

- `flydigi/gpa6.py`: `f2a01cb562248e9c27125bc695d1ace3ea6f9f651aff5e533cfac21c20dba8c4`
- `flydigi/waveform.py`: `2f62811b95e4872c6287703152a5930bc4efb0aa17d650f9d9e0036ffa6d8e5b`

Offline fixture attribution and provenance are in `tests/fixtures/apex6/README.md`.
No vendor executable is included by this port.

The experimental snapshot and neutral-rehearsal sequence in
`src/apex6/experiment/Session.*` additionally follows the same handoff's
`flydigi/gpa6_config.py` and `flydigi/apex6_experiment.py` (MIT). Windows query-only
transport, supervision and terminal cancellation ownership are implemented
separately; no claim of physical lifecycle validation is inherited from that source.

## SteamlessController DualSense fork

The VIIPER request framing, patched-sidecar compatibility checks, compact
DualSense feedback framing, and Windows sidecar lifecycle in
`src/dualsense/*` and `src/platform/windows/WindowsVirtualDualSense.cpp` were
adapted from and validated against the SteamlessController DualSense fork:

- Project: https://github.com/david419kr/steamless-controller-XB-PS-NS

## VIIPER and usbip-win2 runtime components

The offline installer redistributes the pinned patched VIIPER integrated
library and sidecar fallback (GPL-3.0), plus the OSSign usbip-win2 0.9.8.0 x64
release installer built from upstream commit
`83bd1f781d57ed6efdf15530c55710cf5d4482bc` and signed through Microsoft
attestation (BSD-2-Clause). The corresponding VIIPER source reference/patch and
complete license texts are installed under `Licenses`.

## HidHide

The mandatory DualSense-mode physical-controller isolation uses the public HidHide IOCTL
contract and configuration semantics. The implementation was validated against:

- Project: https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide
- Reference commit: `2b950fd9393e1644b4199f6eb4999e1720f0c6e9`
- Reference files: `Shared/HidHideIoctlContract.h`,
  `HidHideCLI/src/FilterDriverProxy.cpp`, and `DEVELOPER.md`
- Copyright: 2020 Eric Korff de Gidts; 2021-2024 Benjamin Höglinger-Stelzer
- License: MIT

The offline installer redistributes the official signed HidHide 1.5.230 x64
installer and its MIT license. It leaves a pre-existing installation owned by
the user unless complete dependency removal is explicitly requested.

## Playnite SDK

The Playnite integration plugin (`playnite/ApexSenseBridge`) references and compiles against the Playnite SDK:

## Playnite NX Audio Switcher

The Windows `IPolicyConfig` declaration and three-role default-endpoint update
used by `WindowsAudioEndpointProtection.cpp` were adapted from Playnite NX
Audio Switcher's `AudioDeviceManager.cs`:
