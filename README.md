# ApexSenseBridge 0.6.3

**Development build: Apex6 Pro integrated beta.** Direct USB grip output is now
available through `bridge-triggers`, Tray manual pre-start, and Playnite's
pre-launch hook. Tray/CLI also offer an explicitly selected experimental 2.4 GHz
mode, limited to ten minutes of active feedback. Opt-in is disabled by default.
Adaptive triggers, Bluetooth and onboard-profile switching remain unsupported on Apex6. Integrated hardware
qualification is pending. See [setup and qualification](docs/APEX6_INTEGRATED_BETA.md).

> **Bridge your Flydigi APEX 4 & APEX 5 controller into a native virtual PlayStation 5 DualSense on Windows.**  
> Experience authentic in-game Adaptive Triggers (FORCEADAPT), rich Haptic Feedback, motion gestures, and verified touchpad shortcuts with sub-2 ms latency.

## ⚡ Key Highlights in 0.6.3

- **🛡️ Non-destructive uninstall:** ApexSenseBridge never uninstalls USBip,
  preserves HidHide and user data by default, and requires separate explicit
  consent plus verified provenance before removing HidHide.
- **🔐 Verified updates and releases:** All automatic update paths validate the
  exact official setup asset, version, product and Authenticode publisher. CI
  blocks inconsistent versions, stale packages, bad checksums and unsigned
  release payloads.
- **🛡️ New USBip 0.9.8.0 Kernel Driver:** Upgraded from the vulnerable 0.9.7.7 to the official Microsoft-attestation-signed `OSSign 0.9.8.0 x64` build (upstream commit `83bd1f78`). Fixes the infamous send-spinlock freeze (`DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION 0x133`) and memory corruption bug (`4139f44`).
- **🎛️ Onboard APEX 5 Profiles (1–4) per Game:** Configure a specific onboard hardware profile (1 to 4) automatically per game in Playnite and the Standalone Tray App. The previous profile is cleanly restored upon exit.
- **✨ Flydigi Space Station Macro Whitelisting:** Keyboard/mouse shortcuts and standard-button remaps configured in Flydigi Space Station remain available while the physical gamepad is isolated. Rear buttons M1–M4 must be assigned in Space Station; a standard virtual DualSense cannot expose them as four independent buttons.
- **🎮 Space Station Proxy Isolation:** Temporarily hides the verified GeniTech gamepad bus and any existing or late-created DualSense/XInput proxies while ApexSenseBridge is active, preventing duplicate or frozen controllers in games such as Minecraft with Controlify.
- **🔒 Safe Tray/Playnite Coexistence:** A session-ownership lock prevents the Tray and Playnite extension from terminating or replacing each other's bridge process. Run one automation owner per game for predictable notifications and lifecycle handling.
- **🔎 Detection and Touchpad Fixes:** Short titles such as `Control` no longer match utilities such as Controlify, and the standard `View` → touchpad-click path remains immediate during rapid consecutive presses.
- **📚 More Reliable Executable Learning:** Concurrent game processes are tracked independently, repeated sightings no longer restart the 30-second stability window, elevated executable paths use a restricted Windows query fallback, and validated bindings are flushed during Tray shutdown.
- **🧰 Installer Verification Fix:** Corrects the registry-key escaping bug that could report a successful USBip installation as failed, then misclassify it as unregistered driver remnants on the next setup run.
- **🏎️ Blazing Fast Initialization (0.28s):** Built-in in-process `libVIIPER v0.7.0-asb7` backend with sub-millisecond USB attachment and loopback-only communication.

## 🔒 Runtime Architecture & Double-Input Protection

```text
Non-DualSense / Standard Game:
APEX Controller ──► Native XInput ──► Game (ApexSenseBridge is completely idle)

Supported DualSense Game:
APEX Controller ──► ApexSenseBridge (C++20 Engine) ──► Virtual DualSense ──► Game
                      └── HidHide isolates physical gamepad
                          (Space Station M/K macros remain whitelisted)
```

- **Zero In-Game Injection:** No process injection, DLL hijacking, or memory tampering. All translation operates strictly via OS-level HID/controller interfaces and standard Windows APIs.
- **Sub-2 ms Latency:** Measured 0.67–1.54 ms p99 report forwarding in active gameplay at ~800–900 Hz.
- **Fail-Closed Isolation:** If physical controller isolation cannot be guaranteed, the session halts safely to prevent confusing dual-input states.

## 🚀 Installation & Getting Started

> [!TIP]
> For common diagnostic questions, minidump analysis, or setup help, consult the [Knowledge Base & Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Option A: Standard Offline Installer (Recommended)
1. Download **`ApexSenseBridge-Setup.exe`** from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/ReynArts/ApexSenseBridge/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer (elevates once as Administrator).
   - Installs the core engine, Tray app, and Control Panel under `%ProgramFiles%\ApexSenseBridge`.
   - Bundles certified `usbip-win2 0.9.8.0` and `HidHide 1.5.230`.
   - Automatically registers the Playnite extension if Playnite is installed.
3. **Restart your PC** if prompted (required after installing or updating the USBip driver).

Uninstalling ApexSenseBridge never removes USBip. This is intentional: the
upstream USBip filter removal restarts Windows USB hubs and must be handled
separately from Windows Settings if the user really wants to remove it. HidHide
is also kept by default and can only be removed after a separate default-No
confirmation when its exact ApexSenseBridge install provenance is verified.
Settings, logs, learned associations and Playnite profiles are kept by default;
a separate prompt controls their deletion. Silent uninstall preserves all
drivers and data unless `/REMOVEUSERDATA` is explicitly supplied for data only.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Upgrading from 0.9.7.x:** If you have an older USBip package installed, uninstall it in Windows Settings (*Installed Apps*), restart Windows, and then run setup. This avoids the known upstream installer hang on *"Uninstalling USBip..."*.
>
> Versions 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 could falsely report that USBip failed even when
> `usbip-install.log` recorded success. This verification bug is fixed in
> 0.6.3. Do not repeatedly run the older installer or remove driver packages
> manually with `pnputil`.

### Option B: Portable Package
1. Download **`ApexSenseBridge-Portable.zip`**.
2. Extract the archive anywhere on your PC.
3. Run `Install-Drivers.cmd` as Administrator once to install the required kernel drivers, then restart Windows.
4. Launch `Start-ApexSenseBridge.cmd` or `ApexSenseBridgeTray.exe`.

---

## 🖥️ Usage Modes

### 1. Standalone System Tray App (Steam, Epic, EA, Game Pass, etc.)
- Launch **`ApexSenseBridgeTray.exe`** (or enable *Launch at Windows startup*).
- Sits silently in the System Tray.
- **Automatic Detection:** Launches and closes the DualSense bridge automatically when any of the 206+ supported games start.
- **Dynamic Executable Learning:** Detects renamed, modded, elevated or multi-process game executables after 30 seconds of a stable automatically detected session while filtering out game launchers (Steam, Epic, EA, Ubisoft). Force Continuous Activation alone cannot identify which game should own an executable.
- **Dashboard & Per-Game Profiles:** Right-click the Tray icon to open the game list, force a specific profile, or assign a dedicated APEX 5 hardware slot (1–4) for each game.

### 2. Playnite Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with Playnite Desktop and Fullscreen modes.
- Game launches automatically initiate the bridge, isolate the physical pad, and apply profile mappings.
- Right-click any game in Playnite > **ApexSenseBridge** to customize trigger remapping, touchpad gesture profiles, or onboard APEX 5 hardware slots.
- Do not run the Tray and Playnite automation for the same game. Version 0.6.2 protects the active session from being killed, but selecting one owner avoids duplicate notifications and ambiguous start/stop events.

## 👆 Touchpad Gesture Emulation

For games that use DualSense touchpad swipes for in-game mechanics, ApexSenseBridge translates intuitive physical controller shortcuts:

| Game Profile | Controller Action | Virtual DualSense Touch Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Spider-Man 2** | Hold `View` / Hold `D-pad Up` | Swipe Left (FNSM App) / Swipe Up/Down (Camera) |
| **Miles Morales** | Hold `View` | Swipe Left (FNSM App) |
| **Ghost of Tsushima** | Hold `D-pad Right` + Flick Right Stick | Directional Wind Swipe in flick direction |
| **Warframe** | Hold `RB` + Press `A/B/X/Y` | Ability Swipes (Up / Down / Left / Right) |
| **Standard DualSense** | Press `View` | Touchpad Click (no directional swipe) |

Rear buttons M1–M4 are not independent controls in a standard DualSense input
report. Assign them to standard controller buttons or keyboard/mouse inputs in
Flydigi Space Station; ApexSenseBridge keeps the verified mapping service
authorized through HidHide during an active session.

---

## 🛡️ Security, Signing & Crash Recovery

- **Authenticode Signed:** All executables (`ApexSenseBridge.exe`, `ApexSenseBridgeTray.exe`, `ApexSenseBridgeControl.exe`, `viiper.exe`, `libVIIPER.dll`, installer) are digitally signed to eliminate Windows SmartScreen warnings.
- **Auto-Recovery Watchdog & RunOnce:** If a game crashes or power is lost, controller visibility and original APEX onboard profiles are automatically restored via an armed watchdog and HKCU RunOnce registry protection.
- **Manual Visibility Restoration:** Should you ever need to manually unhide your controller, open the Control Panel or run:
  ```powershell
  ApexSenseBridge.exe restore-controller-visibility
  ```

## 🏗️ Building from Source

### Requirements
- Windows 10 / 11 x64
- Visual Studio 2022 or 2026 (Desktop C++ & Windows SDK)
- CMake 3.25+ (4.2+ for Visual Studio 2026)
- Inno Setup 6 (for packaging)

```powershell
# 1. Build native engine and tests
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1
ctest --test-dir .\build-win -C Release --output-on-failure

# 2. Build VIIPER backend and installer
.\scripts\build-libviiper-windows.ps1
.\scripts\build-viiper-windows.ps1  # Requires Go on PATH; installer also needs this sidecar
.\scripts\build-installer.ps1
.\scripts\verify-version-consistency.ps1 -CheckArtifacts
```

Opt-in Apex6 Pro grip streaming is available through the normal application;
see the [integrated beta guide](docs/APEX6_INTEGRATED_BETA.md),
[engineering findings](docs/APEX6_FINDINGS.md), and
[verification status](docs/APEX6_INTEGRATED_VERIFICATION.md). Experimental dongle
findings and recovery limits are recorded [here](docs/APEX6_DONGLE_INVESTIGATION.md).
Adaptive triggers, Bluetooth and onboard-profile switching remain unsupported on Apex6.
The separate `ApexSenseBridgeCapture.exe` provides output-isolated input and
original DualSense PCM [diagnostics](docs/APEX6_CAPTURE.md).

The separate `ApexSenseBridgeHapticOffline.exe` now provides an
[offline Apex6Pro GPA6 codec, signed-PCM DSP, and WAV-to-packet preview](docs/APEX6_HAPTICS_OFFLINE.md).
It has no device transport and cannot enable physical haptics.

An opt-in [Apex6 query-only experiment utility](docs/APEX6_EXPERIMENT.md) adds
explicit shared/exclusive readback, cooperative session locking, and offline
neutral-lifecycle rehearsal. A separately built neutral-only executable adds
physical lifecycle qualification behind exact-manifest, interactive five-minute
approval. The query tool still cannot send actuator commands. Neither experiment
is included in release packages; shared readback and physical neutral recovery
retain their separate diagnostic approval requirements.

The separate opt-in `ApexSenseBridgeApex6LiveBridge.exe` now implements
[experimental original-PCM grip streaming](docs/APEX6_LIVE_BRIDGE.md), with fresh
live-scope approval, console gain controls, native output limits, and sessions up
to 60 seconds. Use `scripts/Invoke-Apex6LiveBridge.ps1` for supervised fixture and
native-game diagnostics. It is not packaged; normal sessions use the integrated
backend and its readiness, ownership and stop lifecycle instead.

Before publishing a tag, follow the clean-VM matrix in
[`RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md). The release workflow rejects a
tag/version mismatch, a stale package, a bad checksum or an unsigned payload.
